- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jamblefoot
- 👀 I’m interested in making fun games for people to play. I have made a variety of mobile apps for Android (and a little iOS), and have lately been working in Unity on a dog walking simulator for VR and nonVR.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning iOS development, Flutter, character modeling with Blender, and compute shaders.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on games, or honestly really anything at this point.
- 📫 You can reach me at stufco.info@gmail.com or mark@stufco.com, though tbh the first one's probably a little more dependable

Thanks for stopping by!
