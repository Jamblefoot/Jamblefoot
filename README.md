- Hi, I’m @Jamblefoot
- I’m interested in making fun games for people to play. I have made a variety of mobile apps for Android (and a little iOS), and have lately been working in Unity on a dog walking simulator for VR and nonVR.
- I’m currently learning iOS development, Flutter, compute shaders, and PHP.
- You can reach me at mark@stufco.com

Thanks for stopping by!
